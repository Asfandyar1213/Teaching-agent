## 🌟 Features

- **Adaptive Teaching**: Teaching agents that can:
  - Generate dynamic curricula based on student performance
  - Monitor and evaluate learning progress
  - Adjust teaching strategies in real-time
  - Infer learning difficulties and adapt accordingly

- **Intelligent Learning**: Student agents that:
  - Process and understand provided curricula
  - Learn from structured teaching sequences
  - Provide feedback on learning progress
  - Adapt to different teaching styles

- **Dynamic Environment**: A flexible task environment that:
  - Supports varying levels of task complexity
  - Provides meaningful feedback
  - Enables curriculum-based difficulty adjustment
  - Simulates real-world learning scenarios

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch 1.9.0 or higher
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Asfandyar1213/Teaching-agent.git
cd Teaching-agent
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
